FOR NOTE: colors.cpp is my code and submission for "Lab 14: Color Class".
class-ex.cpp is simply the lecture code with a couple added notes on the code.
My reasoning for having both pushed into the repo is because I also use git for
saving/accessing notes between the two systems that I work on (Windows PC, Linux Laptop).
